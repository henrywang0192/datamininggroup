The hyper-parameters for which the average score over all inner iterations is best, is reported as the `best_params_`, `best_score_`, and `best_estimator_`(best decision tree). This best decision tree is then evaluated with the test set from the `cross_val_score` (the outer CV loop).

    "For some classification algorithms, scaling of the data is critical (like KNN, SVM, Neural Nets). For other classification algorithms, data scaling is not necessary (like Naive Bayes and Decision Trees). _Take a minute to think about why this is the case!!_ But using scaled data with an algorithm that doesn't explicitly need it to be scaled does not hurt the results of that algorithm."

    "Q10. The distance calculation method is central to the KNN algorithm. By default, `KNeighborsClassifier` uses  Euclidean distance as its metric (but this can be changed). Because of the distance calculations, it is critical to scale the data before running Nearest Neighbor!\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed why dimensionality reduction may also be needed with KNN because of the curse of dimensionality. So we may want to also perform a dimensionality reduction with PCA before running KNN. PCA should only be performed on scaled data! (Remember that you can also reduce dimensionality by performing feature selection and feature engineering.) \n",
    "\n",
    "An important note about scaling data and dimensionality reduction is that they should only be performed on the **training** data, then you transform the test data into the scaled, PCA space that was found on the training data. (Refer to the concept of [data leakage](https://machinelearningmastery.com/data-leakage-machine-learning/).)\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you are doing cross-validation, the scaling and PCA needs to happen *inside of your CV loop*. This way, it is performed on the training set for the first fold, then the test set is put into that space. On the second fold, it is performed on the trainng set for the second fold, and the test set is put into that space. And so on for the remaining folds. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this with scikit-learn, you must create what's called a `Pipeline` and pass that in to the cross validation. This is a very important concept for Data Mining and Machine Learning, so let's practice it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do the following:\n",
    "* Create a `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` object to standardize the dataset’s features (mean = 0 and variance = 1). (Do not call `fit` on it yet. Just create the `StandardScaler` object.)\n",
    "* Create a `sklearn.decomposition.PCA` object to perform PCA dimensionality reduction. (Do not call `fit` on it yet. Just create the `PCA` object.)\n",
    "* Create a `sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier`. The number of neighbors defaults to 5 (k=5). Go ahead and change it to 7. (Do not call `fit` on it yet. Just create the `KNeighborsClassifier` object.)\n",
